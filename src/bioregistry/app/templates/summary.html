    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of the <a href="https://cthoyt.com/2020/04/19/inspector-javerts-xref-database.html">Inspector
        Javert's Xref Database</a> was to extract all the xrefs from OBO ontologies in the OBO Foundry. However,
        most ontologies took a lot of creative freedom in how what prefixes they used to refer to which
        resources, and they therefore had to be normalized. Unfortunately, most did not appear in popular
        registries like MIRIAM, so the Bioregistry was created to store this information and facilitate
        downstream data integration. Later, the Bioregistry became a tool that enabled the investigation of the
        discrepancies between MIRIAM, OBO Foundry, OLS, and other biological registries.
    </p>
    <h2>Bioregistry Coverage</h2>
    <p>
        This two-sided comparison shows how well the Bioregistry covers each external registry. In the case of
        Wikidata, it's difficult to know exactly how many relevant properties there are.

    </p>
    <p>
        Additional external registries that have been queued for alignment can be listed via the
        <a href="https://github.com/bioregistry/bioregistry/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22External+Registry%22">GitHub
            issue tracker</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>How Complete is the Bioregistry?</h3>
    <p>
        While many of the resources reported above are finite, Wikidata is a bit more difficult. Because it is a
        general-purpose ontology (for lack of a better word), it contains many properties that are irrelevant
        for the Bioregistry. Further, its properties that are relevant are labeled in a variety of ways. The GAS
        service might provide a solution that enables graph traversal over the various hierarchies of properties
        (see <a href="https://w.wiki/qMG">this</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        Biological databases, ontologies, and resource will continue to be generated as we learn about new and
        exciting phenomena, so the medium-term plan to grow the Bioregistry is to continue to cover resources
        that are not covered by the other resources it references. New external registries can be suggested on
        the Bioregistries GitHub <a href="https://github.com/bioregistry/bioregistry/issues/new">issue
        tracker</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/bioregistry/bioregistry/labels/External%20Registry">External
        Registry</a> label. Further, there are <a
            href="https://github.com/bioregistry/bioregistry#-contributing">contribution guidelines</a> on the
        GitHub site to help guide potential contributors towards small but meaningful first contributions. It is
        expected that all contributors will be listed as co-authors in the eventual manuscript describing this
        resource.
    </p>
    <h3>Why does the Bioregistry not completely cover some resources?</h3>
    <p>
        While the Bioregistry has been completely aligned with the OBO Foundry, the OLS,
        MIRIAM, Wikidata, and Name-to-Thing, the coverage summaries show that it does not
        completely cover other resources. This is due to the lack of or low
        quality metadata associated with records in other resources. In many cases, there
        is not enough information to determine what the resource is, the resource has moved
        to a non-obvious new location, the resource has been superseded by another resource (e.g.,
        TrEMBL is not part of UniProt), or the resource has been decommissioned. In the case of the
        BioPortal, records are not automatically added to the Bioregistry because of the general
        poor quality of its ontologies that can not be automatically mapped to Bioregistry through
        other means.
    </p>
    <h2>Overlap between External Registries</h2>
    <p>
        After normalization and integration in the Bioregistry, it's possible to investigate the overlap between
        pairs of other registries. It can be seen that the MIRIAM and Name-to-Thing (N2T) registries are
        effectively the same because N2T imports from MIRIAM. It can also be seen that OLS and OBO Foundry have
        a very high overlap, where the OLS includes several ontologies that are not included in OBO Foundry.
        Notably, this discrepancy contains the highly regarded Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO).

    <h3>Highly Conserved Resources</h3>
    <p>
        The following chart shows how often entries in the Bioregistry have few or many references to external
        registries. A few resources appear in all external registries, such as the NCBI Taxonomy database.
        However, the notable lack of inclusion of controlled vocabularies that aren't <i>technically</i>
        ontologies into the OBO Foundry and OLS severely lacks their ability to cover some of the most used
        resources like the HGNC. Entries with no references are uniquely curated in the Bioregistry.

             alt="Reference Counts"/>
    </p>
    <h2>Licensing</h2>
    <p>
        Licenses are only directly available from OBO Foundry and the OLS. Wikidata contains some licensing
        information, but more would need to be written to handle this.

        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioregistry/bioregistry/main/docs/img/license_coverage.svg"
             alt="License Coverage"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        However, even internally, neither the OBO Foundry nor OLS use a consistent nomenclature for licenses, so
        they were remapped using <a
            href="https://github.com/bioregistry/bioregistry/blob/main/src/bioregistry/compare.py#L19">this
        ruleset</a>. Further, some licenses that were inappropriate for data (e.g., Apache 2.0 License, GNU GPL
        3.0 License, BSD License) appeared infrequently and were collapsed into "Other". Other uncommon and
        infrequent licenses were likewise collapsed into "Other". After, there were still several conflicts
        between the reported license in OBO Foundry and OLS, in which case both were added to the tally. In the
        majority of the conflicts, OBO Foundry reported CC-BY and OLS reported CC 0.

             alt="License Types"/>
    </p>
    <h2>Other Attributes</h2>
    <p>

             alt="Attributes Coverage"/>
    </p>
    <h3>Versioning</h3>
    <p>
        The OLS is the only registry that actually consumes the data it references, and is therefore the only
        registry that reports version information. The OBO Foundry also references versioned data, but does not
        consume it and therefore can not report version information. Wikidata also contains version information
        for some databases, but is not currently viable for generally tracking version information. The other
        registries (e.g., MIRIAM, N2T) do no report version information as their resolution services are
        independent of the data versions. Alternatively, the <a
            href="https://github.com/cthoyt/bioversions">Bioversions</a> project sets out to be a
        registry-independent solution for identifying current versions of different databases, ontologies, and
        resources.
    </p>
    <h3>Pattern</h3>
    <p>
        MIRIAM and Wikidata are only registries that report patterns, though OBO Foundry has a very consistent
        pattern of most OBO ontologies using the <code>^&lt;prefix&gt;:\d{7}$</code> pattern. However, this
        isn't a rule, so it can't be assumed without inspection of some terms from the ontology itself. The
        Bioregistry also has a place to curate patterns for all the entries that do not have a reference in
        MIRIAM.
    </p>
    <h3>Wikidata Database</h3>
    <p>
        It's typically difficult to propose new Wikidata properties to go along with databases, but anyone can
        add entities corresponding to databases. This is one part of the Bioregistry that will require lots of
        manual effort. Eventually, we can develop a minimum information standard for entries in the Bioregistry
        that would be convincing enough for the Wikidata property gatekeepers and the MIRIAM registry.
    </p>
    <h2>Unexpected usage of CURIEs </h2>
    <h3>Misguided Attribution</h3>
    <p>
        In the OBO file format, terms have a description field which allows for the specification
        of a list of CURIEs to consider as provenance. Often, this will point to PubMed identifiers
        or Wikipedia pages. However, many resources create their own prefix with which they identify
        the original curator. For example, in the Gene Ontology, there is a prefix <code>GOC</code> that often
        appears in CURIEs with the initials of the curator such as in <code>GOC:vw</code>. Unfortunately, this
        information is hard to deconvolute because <code>GOC</code> has not been registered with Identifiers.org
        or another resource, the identifiers are not MIRIAM compliant, and it's not obvious to whom
        <code>vw</code> refers since there is no (obvious) resource to resolve these.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the example of the Human Phenotype Ontology, whose prefix is <code>hp</code>, the prefix
        <code>HPO</code> is used to denote curators in the provenance for descriptions. Luckily, they use
        slightly more informative tags such as <code>HPO:skoehler</code>, which can be easily attributed to
        Sebastian Köhler, one of its main contributors. However, it would be much more informative to use a
        CURIE for the ORCID identifier for this author, <code>orcid:0000-0002-5316-1399</code>, which
        immediately addresses all concerns shared across <code>GOC</code> and <code>HPO</code>.
