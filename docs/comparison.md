## Two-Sided Comparison

First, the two-sided comparison shows for each registry, how well the Bioregistry covers it. In the case of Wikidata,
it's difficult to know exactly how many relevant properties there are. The others have not yet been completely subsumed
in order to make sure that the same namespace appearing with different names in each are not added without being
properly mapped together.

## Three-Sided Comparison

After normalization and integration in the Bioregistry, it's possible to investigate the overlap between pairs of other
registries. The Name-to-Thing (N2T) registry is omitted because it is effectively the same as MIRIAM. It can also be
seen that the OLS effectively subsumes the OBO Foundry and includes some extra ontologies.
